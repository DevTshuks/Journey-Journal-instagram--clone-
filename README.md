Its an application used to document your travel journey using the same functionality of Instagram

These wireframes were captured on the Pixel 3a smartphone with 5.6-inch screen with 1080 x 2220, 440dpi.

The core requirements or the functional requirement of the app is to allow the user to create an account to use in the app together with a username, name email address and password input and store the information in the database. Login details, entry details are also stored in the firebase database and in the local database in the device. The use of the Google maps API is to allow the entries to have real time locations and integration with Google maps and the Yandex translate API is to allow the ability to translate the entry descriptions or the application language to suit the userâ€™s needs.

Journey journal was tested on the inbuilt android emulator being the Pixel 3a and an actual android device being a Huawei Y9 prime

My future recommendation is that I wish I could have done more on this application and eventually fixing these problems and making it into something worthwhile. My inspiration for the theme was inspired by Instagram app as it has all the necessary APIs and other pages which one can benchmark and use to make Journey Journal better. Another future recommendation is to find better resources and more time to work on this project and enhance it.
